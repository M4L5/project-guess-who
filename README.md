# Project Guess Who

This was Technigo bootcamp's 5th week and we had to make a game based on below actions:

- Create and manipulate objects
- Create and manipulate arrays
- Array methods such as forEach() and filter()
- More about manipulating the DOM using Javascript
- How to structure your code in functions
- How to plan and think about game logic

## The problem

I tried to follow the instructions we got from Technigo to understand the project and what they wanted us to create. I had a hard time understanding, had to rewatch videos and look at some code examples to understand how and why.
